# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
#### *Created an interactive dashboard to display bacteria that live inside the human body and are able to synthesize protein using Plotly.js and HTML/CSS.*

## Project Overview
This project consisted of creating a dashboard that displayed information about bacteria that live inside the human's belly button from a sample of hundreds of people. As demonstrated, the dashboard allows one to visualize each persons demographic information, Top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button - and the bacteria cultures per sample.
